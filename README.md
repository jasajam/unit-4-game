# unit-4-game
A game created using jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

##About this Game
This is a quick game! You will find instructions for the game upon loading in the browser. It uses jQuery to listen for a user's attempts to match and not exceed a random number (sort of like the card game 21). It's, therefore, helpful in getting a window into how to make a webpage interactive on a base-level and then display the interactions for a user. 

##What You Should Do
Enjoy this game! If you inspect the page while playing, you will be able to see the random numbers that are at play in the game. You might improve on the game with cool enhancements that come to mind!
